Smart Chat Surveillance: Detecting Cyber  threats and Emotional distress Using AI
# 📲 ChatShield – WhatsApp Threat Detection System

ChatShield is an AI-powered system designed to detect cybersecurity threats in WhatsApp chat data using a hybrid approach of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Large Language Models (LLM)** with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. It aims to identify phishing, scams, toxic speech, and insider threats by analyzing `.txt` chat exports in real time.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

With the rise of digital communication, platforms like WhatsApp are increasingly used for malicious activities. ChatShield provides an intelligent risk detection framework that:

- Analyzes chat content
- Identifies threats based on semantics and patterns
- Highlights risky messages
- Generates actionable insights

It is built to serve **educational institutions, corporates, parents, and law enforcement** in monitoring and securing communication environments.

## 🎯 Features

✅ Detects multiple threat types:
- Phishing
- Scam/Fraud
- Toxic or Hate Speech
- Insider Threats

✅ Combines LLMs (like GPT) and fine-tuned ML models  
✅ Stores contextual embeddings using Milvus  Vector DB  
✅ Provides a modern **React.js dashboard** for results  
✅ Flags and explains individual risky messages  
✅ Enables **real-time or post-event** analysis

## 📦 System Workflow

1. User uploads a WhatsApp `.txt` file
2. Preprocessing: Clean, extract sender/message, normalize timestamps
3. Semantic Chunking (300–500 words per chunk)
4. Embedding generation using sentence-transformers or OpenAI embeddings
5. Embeddings stored in Milvus with metadata
6. Each chunk:
   - Labeled by LLM (zero/few-shot classification)
   - Verified by 4 separate ML classifiers (RoBERTa, GRU)
7. Final threat scores + flagged messages are shown on the UI

---

## 📊 Model Architecture

- **RoBERTa Model** (fine-tuned on toxic/offensive content)
  - Used for phishing, scam, and hate speech classification
- **GRU Model**
  - Used for detecting insider threats based on sequential user activity
- **RAG Module**
  - Provides context-aware validation and reduces false positives
- **LLM Layer**
  - Enhances prediction with semantic reasoning

---

## 🖥️ User Interface (UI)

- Drag-and-drop `.txt` chat file upload
- Real-time threat scores
- Highlighted risky messages with threat keywords
- File-wise threat history
- Downloadable threat reports
- Indicators for LLM vs. ML model agreement

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

| Threat Type | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Phishing | 94.2% | 93.5% | 95.0% | 94.2% |
| Scam | 91.8% | 90.7% | 92.4% | 91.5% |
| Toxic Speech | 95.6% | 96.0% | 94.8% | 95.4% |
| Insider Threat | 98.7% | 95.2% | 94.0% | 95.1% |
